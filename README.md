# AJTech-Blog-Website

I need help on this. Any help will be appreciated
I am creating a personal website (blog) and I want you guys to help me with it.

AJTech website (blog) is a website I am creating and I got inspiration from a video tutorial I was watching on my computer. The name of the creator was Brad Traversy. I have worked almost 90% of the project and I want some small touches and I will be very grateful if I get any assistance from you guys.
